## Design Criteria
1. Meet the requirements of the [Corda Network Map Service protocol](https://docs.corda.net/network-map.html), both documented and otherwise.
2. Completely stateless - capable of running in load-balanced clusters.
3. Efficient use of I/O to serve 5000+ concurrent read requests per second from a modest server.
4. Transparent filesystem design to simplify maintenance, backup, and testing.

## How to use this image
```  
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 cordite/network-map
```
Once the node is running, you will be able to see the UI for accessing network map at `https://localhost:8080`
